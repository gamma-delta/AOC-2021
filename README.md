# Advent of Code 2021

in [PLEASE](https://github.com/gamma-delta/please) if I can or APL if I can't

## To Run APL Code

`dyalog DYALOG_LINEEDITOR_MODE=1 -script dayXX.dyalog` when in WSL

or just use the script

I don't know why it doesn't work on cygwin or cmd, dyalog kinda forgot
scripting exists (they want you to do everything in their IDE).
